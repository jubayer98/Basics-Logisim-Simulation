# Basics of Logisim Simulation

This repository contains the design and simulation of several common logic circuits using Logisim, a graphical tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Logisim**: Download and install from the [official website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

### Running the Simulations

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubayer98/Basics-Logisim-Simulation.git
   cd Basics-Logisim-Simulation
   ```

2. **Open Logisim:**
   - Launch Logisim.
   - Open the `.circ` files included in this repository.

3. **Simulate:**
   - Use the input pins to test the functionality of each circuit.
   - Observe the output to verify the correct operation of the logic gates and circuits.

## Contribution
